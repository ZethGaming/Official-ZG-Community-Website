     <h1>Welcome To ZG Community</h1>

 <p1>Hello Fellow Gamers! Welcome To ZG Community! Here you can buy merch such as Hoodies, Hats, Mugs, and More!
   ZG Community is my way of telling you more about myself and connecting to the community even more. My Goal with this is to be able to connect with you and even learn about you all! As basic as this site is, I have hope of turning it into a forum and a way for everyone to find others to support, and game with!
 </p1>

 <p1>On this site you can find links to my channel as well as my <a href="https://discord.gg/WkAegXjE4N" target="_blank">Discord Server!</a> Together We Can Grow!</p1>

 <h3>What Do I Do if I can't join the discord server or if the link is invalid?</h3>

 <p1>If your unable to join our server, the link may be invalid/expired. To get around this issue, go to <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/imzethgaming" target="_blank"></a> my twitch channel and go to the about me. Then look for the discord icon and click to join the server. </p1>

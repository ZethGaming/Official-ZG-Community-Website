     <h1>About Me</h1>
   </div>
 </header>

<p1>My name is Cody, but most people call me "Zeth". I stream games such as Call of Duty Warzone, Elite Dangerous Core, Minecraft, and much more over on twitch and I do fun community events such as Warzone with Followers, Or Q&A Sessions in Discord.</p1>

<h1>What Do I like to do for fun?</h1>

<p1>Some things I enjoy doing in my spare time are hiking, gaming, and hanging out with friends and family. Do I have any pets? the answer is yes! I do have a pet, I have a 4 year old German Shephard named Storm! besides her, i do not have any other pets. </p1>

<h1>What made me want to start streaming?</h1>

<p1>I began streaming back in 2019 but never took it seriously, I eventually decided to make a new Twitch Account and go by the name imzethgaming. I didn't actually start going live until the past year 2020. The idea of being live and chatting with those who come into chat and doing what I love seemed worth it. And it was! I don't regret becoming a twitch streamer whatsoever, the experience has been absolutely amazing and fun. I get that being a content creator isn't for everyone, but I was up for a challenge to see if I could become successful and meet as many people who became part of my community as much as I could. Without all your support, I wouldn't be where I am today, so whether or not you made it this far, I just want to thank you for your support and know that your absolutely amazing! </p1>
